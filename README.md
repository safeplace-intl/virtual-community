Choose `Reopen Folder Locally` to initialize the repository in a dev container. The container will run all of the setup and installation commands, and then start up the development server.

Open an integrated terminal `Terminal -> New Terminal` and you can view the config as it runs the container setup. You will see something like this

### Why dev containers?

Using a dev container, we make sure that everyone on the team is using the same working environment, and reducing errors caused by different local environments and configurations.

The container includes pre-installed VSCode extensions, let us know if there are any that you think the team should be using!
